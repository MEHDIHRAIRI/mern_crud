this is mern crud project.

database : i used mongodb cloud database to store data

how to open the project :

1- clone the project in your desktop
2- open the project with VS Code
3- npm install axios moment react-file-base64 redux redux-thunk ( this command will install axios, moment, react-file ( manage photos ) , redux )
4- npm install @material-ui/core ( install material-ui used for the user interface )
5- npm install @material-ui/icons ( so we can use icons from material-ui ) 
6- npm install mongoose ( so we can use mongodb )
7- npm install body-parser cors express 
8- open 2 terminals ( one for the client folder (front) and another one for the server (back))  
9- run the project ( npm start from both of the terminals )

Note :
you may have some problems using crud and that's because mongodb cloud must get your ip address )
